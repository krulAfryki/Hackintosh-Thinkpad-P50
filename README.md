## Instructions
### Before Everything
* To make life easier, you'll want to have another mac with you. 
  * You can do it without another mac, but that'll be complicated.
  * The main idea is simple, make a macOS installer usb drive and copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of the USB drive.

### Set BIOS

### Make USB Drive
* First, download macOS 12 (Or later, but no promises if it still works) from Apple App Store.
* Then, follow [How to create a bootable installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372) to create a macOS installer drive.
  * Essentially, go to Disk Utility - View - Show All Devices
  * Find your USB drive, right click, Erase.

  * Go to terminal, run `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume`.

  * Done! You have a bootable USB Drive with macOS installer.

### Install
* With the drive plugged in, boot the machine while pressing F12 many times until you see the boot selection screen.
* Select boot from your USB drive.
* OpenCore should launch, and select Install macOS.
* Install macOS as normal.
* If you have the exact same configuration as my system, everything should be working.

## Warning
* I do not have time to help others debug your system since I am not there, it's not my system, and I am not getting paid for it.
* If you run into bugs or cannot boot, it is always great to consult [TonyMacX86](https://www.tonymacx86.com).
* Running into issues is one of the must-haves to have a complete hackintosh experience. Enjoy ;)
* Use this configuration on your own risk as I am not responsibile for damaging anyone's system.
